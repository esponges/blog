AI Automated Engineers are here, are we doomed?

Not long since AI experts were predicting that Software Engineers would eventually be automated by AI, as many other professions have been. With the release of Devin the first —publicly introduced— AI Software Engineer the race has started and there’s been a lot of buzz out there about it, where many developers —as seen with other non tech professionals— have started to worry about this

<insert meme here>

Now the question is not when anymore, but how many and in what degree our jobs will be replaced by AI.

I’ve already covered some of these topics in a past blog post, but as AI development has progressed I think some of the ideas in it still apply and others should be revised.

The state of software engineering automation

It all started with the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2023. It looks like this event was decades ago, but as a famous politician once said “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen. (V. Lenin)”, as this is definitely the case. We were all amazed of how this chatbot could be given any question and give most of the time an appropriate response. For us engineers it meant that we didn’t have to rely exclusively on SO or other diffuse sources when googling but rather use this tool as a comprehensive assistant that could help us to understand any concept or bug regarding our software.

Not long after ChatGPT, Github Copilot was released. This was the second big step for us engineers to have an AI tool that was directly embedded into our source code that could help us, when having enough context, to predict which would be the next lines of our code, and eventually Copilot Chat was also released which was along regular Copilot was a perfect combo that would give us extra productivity boost when writing or understanding our code.

Many other ChatGPT-like competitors have launched like Claude, OLLama, nGrok, to name few, and we have almost daily breaking releases of new AI products that could affect the way we work. The investment pace in AI is brutal as venture capitalists work to preempt one another Seeking  big returns on exists. This means that a massive number of new AI tools are still in the oven and will eventually get released and will potentially impact our work.

Can developers be fully automated? 

That depends on what kind of developer. I think some types of developer will, for example some developers that would turn Figma designs and turn them into html or simpler landing pages, and other similars where the tasks such as working on basic PoC for initial projects and very specific developers that did a one lane work with a very few number of technologies. However, most of us developers with some years in the market know that a SD is not a one tool professional, we have to deal with people from different teams, several technologies across different versions and in general, deal with problems that humans will (hopefully) only be able to deal with. Even when existing solutions of full automation are available now, they are not enough for handling some issues that machines can’t deal with, for example Musk automated almost completely one of Teslas gigafactories and he had to rollback back on that decision as apparently many issues arrived where the machines couldn’t solve while humans could do. 

Does the fact that AI tools that replace partially  means that we’ll have less work? Yes, definitely. We will be super powered professionals that will need less time to complete our work and therefore, should be able to have more workload. No more time spent on stupid bugs that were caused by typos or unspotted silly errors and more time on spending in things that matter: architecture design, UX, business overview, best practices and patterns, etc. There will be less open positions for developers? Possibly; if there’s more work that could be done by less developers why would any sane company overhire? The bright side of this, there’s been a lot of discussion of if the workweek could be reduced for all of tech developers as discussed [here], and even Musk  has talked [add source] about an universal income for all the humans since the decrease of the workload will give us less chance to work and earn money.

Finally, I think humans will still require to understand the basics, like a professor of my university once told me: “There are tools that already do this automatically, but to use them properly you have to understand where the output comes from”. 

What about the government?

Will they allow this flood of AI tools to replace the workers of the world? While highly criticised, the EU have been the first to start regulating AI [add link] as they consider that some sensitive tasks should not be made by AI, regulate fake media content, an prevent uncompetitive actions by tech companies, and also possibly enforcing companies to eventually reduce working hours and provide welfare for reduced salaries provoked by lesser billed hours. Governments finally stepping in to enforce the correct use of AI will be crucial to determine the potential impact (positive or negative) to the humanity. [here]’s a very interesting podcast of an advocate of AI regulations exposing why the Wild West state of product releases should be stopped.

What should I do to protect myself against the AI automation threat?

- Don’t over specialize: unless you want to become a wizard in one single technology, probably overspecializing is not the best option, since the AI would probably be able to easily beat you in all ways.
- Become a generalist: this for me is the most viable option. Increasing your range of tools will make very difficult for AI tools to replace you, since most of them will be made for solving specific problems. We’ve seen that existing models are above the average —sometimes mediocre— than most ordinary people any kind of topic you have in mind, however, only specialized AI tools are becoming the real threat to certain professions. This makes sense, since most startups (not even OpenAI or other behemoths) don’t have the scale to do everything right. There will be different winners in each field or customer pain, therefore being a generalist is the way to go. Probably add comments regarding the book Range.
- Become the master of the menaces: By menaces, I’m obviously referring to the AI tools. Learning and understanding these tools, the most detailed possible, will allow you to be the one in control of those tools. You could become a developer in high demand if you become proficient on that. You don’t have to become an AI scientist or similar, for example, I’m learning how to implement Langchain into existing code bases to solve complex problems that otherwise would have required very hard to create algorithms, thus adding AI value to existing products.

I think long gone are the days where us developers were the untouchables professionals, with the highest salaries and the best perks. I think we will be impacted (we’ve already been) by AI. The bright side of this? Opportunists and people who were around only for the good salaries will be out and will relief the pressure for all those developers that are actually passionate about software, with incredible tools to make their job much easier and enjoyable. Bad thing, we’ll probably earn less money for doing what we love. Who knows, maybe less competition from those quitters will make salaries not to drop that much? In my case, I was not part of that cohort that had awesome salaries from 10 years ago, so I’m kind of used to have a decent wage while working on exciting things that I love doing.

Cheer up! Rather than picking a Neo Ludite mentality and curse the inventors of these tools we should be happy to live in a time where they’ve been just released. These are very exciting times that will probably never be repeated and the ones who are one step ahead of the pack could forge a very bright future for themselves and their loved ones.
