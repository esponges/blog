Problem
- You join a new company/team
- On the interviews you were told if you had experience in XYZ, you tell them you do, all good.
- One day you are required to do something in ABC, but you've never done anything related to that.
- This is not optional, you have to do it.
- You were so focused on XYZ, during your entire career, and you never thought (and wanted) to learn ABC.
- What should you do next?

Steps:
- Mindset: You have to be open to learn new unrelated things. Not only new things related to XYZ. But new things in general. This is how things work in the real world and more in the recent years.
- Study: start simple. Do the basics. Maybe codeacademy, some youtube videos, basic projects, etc. You're not expected to be an expert in a week, and some novice errors are expected. Since you already have experience in other languages (hopefully not too different from the one you're learning), you'll learn faster than a complete beginner, and you'll be able to focus your energy on understanding the specific language features. Go over these new specifics as many times as you need to understand them. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but try to find the answers yourself first. You'll learn more that way.
- Create POC: Try to understand where might take place your implementation in the actual codebase. If you're not sure, ask someone. Then create a POC (Proof of Concept) in a brand new project with a similar -but very minimal- structure to the actual codebase. This will help you to understand how to implement your solution in the actual codebase.
- Hands on the actual implementation: Time to actually do something. Start with something very simple, even a console statement is enough. Don't worry about abstracting your code or making it look pretty. Just get something working. Then add a little more. Then a little more. Then a little more. Keep going until you have something that works. Eventually you'll end up having something that works and should be refactored. Don't forget to commit as often as possible, this will help you to see your progress and if something goes wrong it will be easier to go back to a previous state.
- Get feedback: once you have something that works, it doesn't even have to be refactored, show it to someone with experience from your team. Don't be afraid of telling them that you're new to this and you're looking for feedback. They'll be able to tell you if you're doing something wrong (or good enough) and how to improve it. This will save you a lot of time before you get to the point where you have to refactor your code a lot and it could be a headache since you're not familiar with the language.

Title: Adapting to New Challenges: How to Learn and Thrive in Unfamiliar Territory

Introduction:

One day, shortly after joining a new company, I was unexpectedly tasked with implementing a feature in Golang. Previously, I had worked as a frontend engineer using React in a project that utilized Golang as its backend language. However, I had never delved into the backend code since there was a dedicated developer for that aspect. I had convinced myself that I would never have to work with Golang, as I wanted to focus solely on my chosen stack. Little did I know that I would soon be required to take on a significant Golang project in my new role.

When I started my career and decided on my stack (Node.js and React), I dedicated all my efforts to becoming proficient in those technologies. I firmly believed that if an opportunity arose to explore something beyond my stack, I would decline it to avoid distraction from my primary focus. I was determined to specialize and avoid diversions. However, a professional career is rarely a straightforward path, and being prepared for unexpected challenges is crucial.

In my recent blog post (link), I discussed how the rise of AI has impacted professional development. It has become increasingly apparent that being exceptionally skilled in a single language or stack may no longer hold the same professional value. While it remains essential to possess strong problem-solving abilities in general programming, companies often expect professionals to adapt to new challenges and learn different languages and technologies. This has been my recent experience, especially when joining a new company or team.

Joining a new company or team presents exciting opportunities for professional growth. However, it is not uncommon to encounter tasks or responsibilities that lie outside of one's area of expertise. Initially, this can be a daunting situation, particularly if you possess limited knowledge or experience in the required domain. Failing to adopt the right mindset and strategy can burden your daily work and potentially impact your career. In this post, we will explore a step-by-step approach that has consistently helped me effectively tackle unfamiliar challenges and embrace continuous learning.

Step 1: Adopt the Right Mindset
Don't be afraid to say 'I don't know how to do it', but _dont forget_ to continue with 'but I'll figure it out'. Nobody expects you to know something about its clear that is beyond your expertise. But they do expect you to be willing to learn and figure things out. For this mindset is the key.
The first crucial step is to cultivate an open mindset towards learning new, unrelated things. Recognize that the real world demands a diverse skill set, and adaptability is a valuable trait. Embrace the fact that the boundaries of your expertise can be expanded, and be willing to step out of your comfort zone. Embracing a growth mindset will help you approach new challenges with enthusiasm and determination. There's no point on delaying the inevitable, so it's better to start as soon as possible and you'd better have the right mindset.

Step 2: Start with the Basics
When faced with a new domain, start by gaining a fundamental understanding of the subject matter. Begin with beginner-level resources such as online tutorials, coding platforms, or video lectures. There are a ton of resources for beginners -most of them free- like Codecademy, Udemy, Coursera, Freecodecamp that provide interactive courses that can guide you through the basics of various languages and frameworks. By leveraging your existing knowledge in other frameworks/languages, you can grasp new concepts more quickly and efficiently than a complete beginner and it will allow to focus your energy on understanding the specific language features.

As you learn, expect to make novice errors and encounter challenges along the way. It's essential to persevere and keep learning from your mistakes. Take the time to grasp the specific features and nuances of the new language or framework, going over them repeatedly until you gain a solid understanding. While it's always good to ask questions, try to find answers on your own first. The process of self-discovery fosters deeper learning and better retention.

Step 3: Create a Proof of Concept (POC)
Once you have a foundational understanding of the new domain, it's time to apply your knowledge practically. Seek guidance from your team to understand where your implementation might fit into the existing codebase. By asking questions and seeking clarification, you can get a clearer picture of how your solution should be integrated.

To gain confidence and experience, start by creating a Proof of Concept (POC) in a separate project. This POC should mimic the structure and functionality of the actual codebase, but in a minimalistic manner. By doing this, you can experiment and test your ideas without the pressure of working directly on the production code. Create as many POCs as you need, they don't even have to resemble the actual codebase, as long as they help you to understand and practice specifics of your future implementation. The POC(s) will serve as a valuable learning tool and help you understand the practical implementation of your solution and will also bring you confidence in this new domain.

Step 4: Hands-on Actual Implementation
With the POC as your guide, it's time to transition into the actual implementation. Begin with a simple task, even if it's just a print statement. The goal at this stage is to get something working, no matter how basic. Gradually build upon your initial implementation, adding more functionality and complexity as you go. Aim for incremental progress, steadily improving your solution. 

Throughout this process, remember that code quality and abstraction can be refined later. Focus on getting a functional implementation first, and don't be overly concerned with clean code and other good practices, make it work, and once it does, you can take time on making your code better. Commit your code frequently to version control, allowing you to track your progress and revert changes if necessary. I made this blog post (link) of how to create great code, you must write ugly code that works first.

Step 5: Seek Feedback
Once you have a working implementation, seek feedback from experienced colleagues on your team. Be open about your newness to the domain and express your willingness to learn. Also, don't expect that your colleague will do the work for you, while they might help your with some specific questions, you should rely on them only for guidance, not for implementation. That should be enough for you to keep improving your implementation. The reviews can and should be iterative, you're most likely not going to get it right the first time, so don't be afraid to ask for feedback multiple times.
Sharing your progress and seeking guidance can help you identify areas for improvement, rectify any mistakes early on, and streamline your codebase. Leveraging the expertise of others can save you time and prevent headaches down the line. 

Step 6: Celebrate Your Success
There's nothing more rewarding than overcoming a challenge and learning in the process. And believe me, you will learn a lot. You should be proud of your achievement, and hopefully your team will acknowledge all the effort placed on this new challenge. You now have a new highlight on your professional career and who knows, this may take you to new and exciting opportunities that you'd never thought of before.

Conclusion:
Embracing new challenges outside your comfort zone is an essential part of professional growth. By adopting the right mindset, starting with the basics, creating a Proof of Concept, diving into hands-on implementation, and seeking feedback, you can navigate unfamiliar territory successfully. Remember, learning is a continuous journey, and every new experience expands your skill set. So embrace the opportunity to learn ABC, and beyond, and watch as your career blossoms with newfound versatility.
