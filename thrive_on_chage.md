Problem
- You join a new company/team
- On the interviews you were told if you had experience in X, Y, Z, you tell them you do, all good.
- One day you are required to do something in A, B, C, but you've never done anything related to that.
- This is not optional, you have to do it.
- You were so focused on X, Y, Z, during your entire career, and you never thought (and wanted) to learn A, B, C.
- What should you do next?

Steps:
- Mindset: You have to be open to learn new unrelated things. Not only new things related to X, Y, Z. But new things in general. This is how things work in the real world and more in the recent years.
- Study: start simple. Do the basics. Maybe codeacademy, some youtube videos, basic projects, etc. You're not expected to be an expert in a week, and some novice errors are expected. Since you already have experience in other languages (hopefully not too different from the one you're learning), you'll learn faster than a complete beginner, and you'll be able to focus your energy on understanding the specific language features. Go over these new specifics as many times as you need to understand them. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but try to find the answers yourself first. You'll learn more that way.
- Create POC: Try to understand where might take place your implementation in the actual codebase. If you're not sure, ask someone. Then create a POC (Proof of Concept) in a brand new project with a similar -but very minimal- structure to the actual codebase. This will help you to understand how to implement your solution in the actual codebase.
- Hands on the actual implementation: Time to actually do something. Start with something very simple, even a console statement is enough. Don't worry about abstracting your code or making it look pretty. Just get something working. Then add a little more. Then a little more. Then a little more. Keep going until you have something that works. Eventually you'll end up having something that works and should be refactored. Don't forget to commit as often as possible, this will help you to see your progress and if something goes wrong it will be easier to go back to a previous state.
- Get feedback: once you have something that works, it doesn't even have to be refactored, show it to someone with experience from your team. Don't be afraid of telling them that you're new to this and you're looking for feedback. They'll be able to tell you if you're doing something wrong (or good enough) and how to improve it. This will save you a lot of time before you get to the point where you have to refactor your code a lot and it could be a headache since you're not familiar with the language.

Title: Adapting to New Challenges: How to Learn and Thrive in Unfamiliar Territory

Introduction:

When I started my career and decided of what was going to be my stack (I chose nodeJs and React) I was trying to set all energies on to getting very good in it, and I always told myself that if I'd ever have to chance to do something else that might diverge a bit from my stack I would refuse since I didn't want to distract myself from getting very good at what I was doing. I was very focused on my stack and I didn't want to learn anything else and I was very wrong.

As I mentioned in my last blog post (link), with the rise of AI, unless you're extremely good in a language it is probably not (professionally-wise) worth anymore to try to be super good in a single stack or language. Obviously you still have to be very competent enough to solve regular programming issues but most companies also expect you to be able to adapt to new challenges and learn new things, that includes other languages and technologies, and this is something that I've been experiencing a lot lately, more when if you are joining a new company or team.

Joining a new company or team can be an exciting opportunity for professional growth. However, it's not uncommon to find yourself faced with tasks or responsibilities that are outside your area of expertise. Initially, this can be a daunting situation, especially if you have limited knowledge or experience in the required domain. And I don't take the right approach (mental and strategical) it could become a big burden in your daily job and even in your career. In this post, we will explore a step-by-step approach that has helped me through time to tackle unfamiliar challenges effectively and embrace continuous learning.

Step 1: Adopt the Right Mindset
The first crucial step is to cultivate an open mindset towards learning new, unrelated things. Recognize that the real world demands a diverse skill set, and adaptability is a valuable trait. Embrace the fact that the boundaries of your expertise can be expanded, and be willing to step out of your comfort zone. Embracing a growth mindset will help you approach new challenges with enthusiasm and determination.

Step 2: Start with the Basics
When faced with a new domain, start by gaining a fundamental understanding of the subject matter. Begin with beginner-level resources such as online tutorials, coding platforms, or video lectures. Websites like Codecademy provide interactive courses that can guide you through the basics of various languages and frameworks. By leveraging your existing knowledge from XYZ, you can grasp new concepts more quickly and efficiently.

As you learn, expect to make novice errors and encounter challenges along the way. It's essential to persevere and keep learning from your mistakes. Take the time to grasp the specific features and nuances of the new language or framework, going over them repeatedly until you gain a solid understanding. While it's always good to ask questions, try to find answers on your own first. The process of self-discovery fosters deeper learning and better retention.

Step 3: Create a Proof of Concept (POC)
Once you have a foundational understanding of the new domain, it's time to apply your knowledge practically. Seek guidance from your team to understand where your implementation might fit into the existing codebase. By asking questions and seeking clarification, you can get a clearer picture of how your solution should be integrated.

To gain confidence and experience, start by creating a Proof of Concept (POC) in a separate project. This POC should mimic the structure and functionality of the actual codebase, but in a minimalistic manner. By doing this, you can experiment and test your ideas without the pressure of working directly on the production code. The POC will serve as a valuable learning tool and help you understand the practical implementation of your solution.

Step 4: Hands-on Actual Implementation
With the POC as your guide, it's time to transition into the actual implementation. Begin with a simple task, even if it's just a console statement. The goal at this stage is to get something working, no matter how basic. Gradually build upon your initial implementation, adding more functionality and complexity as you go. Aim for incremental progress, steadily improving your solution.

Throughout this process, remember that code quality and abstraction can be refined later. Focus on getting a functional implementation first, and don't be overly concerned with aesthetics. Commit your code frequently to version control, allowing you to track your progress and revert changes if necessary.

Step 5: Seek Feedback
Once you have a working implementation, seek feedback from experienced colleagues on your team. Be open about your newness to the domain and express your willingness to learn. Sharing your progress and seeking guidance can help you identify areas for improvement, rectify any mistakes early on, and streamline your codebase. Leveraging the expertise of others can save you time and prevent headaches down the line.

Conclusion:
Embracing new challenges outside your comfort zone is an essential part of professional growth. By adopting the right mindset, starting with the basics, creating a Proof of Concept, diving into hands-on implementation, and seeking feedback, you can navigate unfamiliar territory successfully. Remember, learning is a continuous journey, and every new experience expands your skill set. So embrace the opportunity to learn ABC, and beyond, and watch as your career blossoms with newfound versatility.
