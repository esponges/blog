Problem
- You join a new company/team
- On the interviews you were told if you had experience in X, Y, Z, you tell them you do, all good.
- One day you are required to do something in A, B, C, but you've never done anything related to that.
- This is not optional, you have to do it.
- You were so focused on X, Y, Z, during your entire career, and you never thought (and wanted) to learn A, B, C.
- What should you do next?

Steps:
- Mindset: You have to be open to learn new unrelated things. Not only new things related to X, Y, Z. But new things in general. This is how things work in the real world and more in the recent years.
- Study: start simple. Do the basics. Maybe codeacademy, some youtube videos, basic projects, etc. You're not expected to be an expert in a week, and some novice errors are expected. Since you already have experience in other languages (hopefully not too different from the one you're learning), you'll learn faster than a complete beginner, and you'll be able to focus your energy on understanding the specific language features. Go over these new specifics as many times as you need to understand them. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but try to find the answers yourself first. You'll learn more that way.
- Create POC: Try to understand where might take place your implementation in the actual codebase. If you're not sure, ask someone. Then create a POC (Proof of Concept) in a brand new project with a similar -but very minimal- structure to the actual codebase. This will help you to understand how to implement your solution in the actual codebase.
- Hands on the actual implementation: Time to actually do something. Start with something very simple, even a console statement is enough. Don't worry about abstracting your code or making it look pretty. Just get something working. Then add a little more. Then a little more. Then a little more. Keep going until you have something that works. Eventually you'll end up having something that works and should be refactored. Don't forget to commit as often as possible, this will help you to see your progress and if something goes wrong it will be easier to go back to a previous state.
- Get feedback: once you have something that works, it doesn't even have to be refactored, show it to someone with experience from your team. Don't be afraid of telling them that you're new to this and you're looking for feedback. They'll be able to tell you if you're doing something wrong (or good enough) and how to improve it. This will save you a lot of time before you get to the point where you have to refactor your code a lot and it could be a headache since you're not familiar with the language.
