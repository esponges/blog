Here is an example of how you could start your introduction:

Authentication and refresh tokens are essential for securing web applications. By using Redux Toolkit and Next.js, you can easily implement a robust authentication system that is both secure and user-friendly. This blog post will show you how to do this using a wrapper layout strategy.

You could then go on to explain the benefits of using Redux Toolkit and Next.js to manage authentication, and introduce the wrapper layout strategy.

In the implementation section, you could provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement authentication and refresh tokens using Redux Toolkit and Next.js using the wrapper layout strategy. Here are some of the key steps you would need to cover:

Install the necessary dependencies.
Create a Redux store and reducers to manage the authentication state.
Create a custom Next.js layout component that wraps all of your application's pages.
Use the wrapper layout component to check the authentication status of the user and redirect them to the login page if they are not authenticated.
Implement a refresh token mechanism to ensure that the user's access token is always valid.
You could include code examples and screenshots to illustrate your points.

In the benefits section, you could discuss the benefits of using this approach to authentication management. Here are some of the key benefits:

Security: The wrapper layout strategy ensures that all pages of your application are protected by authentication. This helps to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your application's resources.
Usability: The refresh token mechanism ensures that users are not logged out unexpectedly if their access token expires. This improves the user experience by making it easier for users to stay logged in to your application.
Simplicity: This approach to authentication management is relatively simple to implement, even for developers who are new to Redux Toolkit and Next.js.
In the conclusion, you could summarize the key points of your blog post and provide links to additional resources for readers who want to learn more about authentication and refresh tokens, Redux Toolkit, and Next.js.

I hope these ideas help you to get started with writing your blog post. -->

Authentication and refresh tokens are essential for securing web applications. However, properly handling sessions and expirations can become a challenge. It's not always clear how to implement these features in a way that is both secure and user-friendly.

In this blog post I'll show you how to leverage from the phantastic Redux Toolkit Query library to implement a robust authentication system that allows users to stay logged in for as long (almost) as they want without having to worry about expiring tokens or session timeouts.

## Introduction

### What are authentication and refresh tokens?

Authentication tokens are used to verify that a user is who they say they are. They are typically generated by the server when a user logs in and are stored in the browser's local storage or session storage. I like storing them in the cookies because they usually have expiration dates and are automatically sent with every request (see downsides here). But you can store them wherever you want.

Usually authentication tokens are short-lived and expire after a certain amount of time. This is done for security reasons, so that if someone steals your token they can't use it forever. However, this can be inconvenient for users who want to stay logged in for longer periods of time. To solve this problem, refresh tokens are used. However, in this blog post we will focus on authentication tokens.

### Using a wrapper layour strategy to persist authentication state

The wrapper layout strategy is a common approach to managing authentication state in Next.js applications. It involves creating a custom layout component that wraps all of your application's pages. This component checks the authentication status of the user and redirects them to the login page if they are not authenticated.

This approach has several benefits:

- Simplicity: This approach to authentication management is relatively simple to implement, even for developers who are new to Redux Toolkit and Next.js.
- Security: The wrapper layout strategy ensures that all pages of your application are protected by authentication. This helps to prevent unauthorized users from accessing your application's resources.
- Usability: The refresh token mechanism ensures that users are not logged out unexpectedly if their access token expires. This improves the user experience by making it easier for users to stay logged in to your application.
