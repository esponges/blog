How to Build a Contextual Chatbot with LangChain and PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM

Something that I've always disliked of using ChatGPT or Bard for understanding a document is that I have always to copy and paste chunks of the document into my actual conversation. This is not only annoying but also time consuming. I've always wanted to have a chatbot that could understand the context of the conversation and the document that I'm reading and be able to answer my questions without having to copy and paste anything.

The great things of contextual chats is that you get rid of the need of having to copy and paste anything. You can just ask your chatbot a question and it will answer you. This is great for reading documents and having a conversation with your chatbot at the same time. This is not only for people that would like to understand more about an specific topic but also for websites that would like to have a chatbot that can answer about their ONLY products or services in an efficient and scalable way.

Fortunately with the rise of technologies like the OpenAI API, Lanchain which is a library made to make developing applications powered by language models easier and PostgreSQL and Drizzle which is the raising star of ORMs, we can now make this possible with a few lines of code.
